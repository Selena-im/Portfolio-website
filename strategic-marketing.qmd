Below are selected projects that showcase my work in strategic marketing, campaign development, and brand management. These examples highlight how I apply leadership, data-informed decision making, and creative direction to drive marketing success.

## Project Title: User Research & Persona-Driven Strategy – Productfolio.com

For this digital marketing optimization project, I led the user research and segmentation strategy for **Productfolio**, a SaaS product management platform. My goal was to improve user acquisition, engagement, and conversion through behavior-based analysis and persona development using Google Analytics 4 (GA4).

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- **Customer Segmentation:** Used GA4 metrics and K-means clustering to segment users based on engagement and intent.
- **Persona Development:** Created three key personas—The Researcher, The Solution Seeker, and The Action Taker—to guide personalized marketing.
- **Funnel Optimization:** Identified a 90.7% drop-off at the sign-up stage and proposed onboarding and CTA enhancements.
- **Content Strategy:** Analyzed top-performing pages to recommend content alignment and stronger conversion pathways.
- **Marketing Analytics:** Interpreted behavioral data to drive precision targeting and optimize user journeys across funnel stages.
