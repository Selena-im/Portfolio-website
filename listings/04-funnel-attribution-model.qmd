**Insight:** Engagement time remained stable (\~0.5–1 min), with occasional spikes. These spikes are likely tied to campaigns or new releases.

### Are the most visited pages also the most engaging?

**Insight:** No direct correlation—some high-traffic pages have only moderate engagement. High-engagement pages are underexposed.

### Dual-Axis Comparison

**Insight:** Pages like `/janet/autozon/dashboard` have high engagement but low visibility—great candidates for internal promotion.

### How sticky is the product? (DAU/MAU)

**Insight:** Stickiness averages \~0.04, well below the 0.15 industry benchmark. Re-engagement strategies are needed.
