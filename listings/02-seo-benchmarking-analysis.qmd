## Objective

Boosted Productfolio.com’s visibility and conversions by targeting high-intent, low-competition keywords through SEO and content optimization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methodology

-   **Independent Variable (IV):** Primary & long-tail keyword targeting\
-   **Dependent Variable (DV):** SERP ranking position\
-   **Methods:** A/B testing, regression analysis, Random Forest\
-   **Tools:** SEMrush, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Google Search Console

We analyzed 29 keywords currently ranking for Productfolio.com using both a **Linear Regression model** and a **Random Forest algorithm**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Linear Regression Model

We used a multiple regression model to test the influence of log-transformed search volume and keyword difficulty on SERP position. An interaction term was included to assess any combined effect.

**Results:**

-   Adjusted R²: -0.0035\
-   p-value: 0.4234\
-   None of the predictors were statistically significant

> Conclusion: The linear model failed to explain the variation in SERP position.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Random Forest Analysis

To account for potential non-linear relationships, we applied a Random Forest model to evaluate variable importance.

**Findings:** - **Keyword Difficulty** emerged as the most important predictor of SERP rank. - **Search Volume** had limited influence.

> Conclusion: Keyword competition is a more powerful SEO lever than search demand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Strategic Implications

1.  **Prioritize keywords** with lower competition rather than just high volume.
2.  **Enhance content** around top-performing, low-difficulty keywords.
3.  Use **GA4 tracking** to monitor engagement, bounce rates, and conversions post-optimization.
4.  Apply **schema markup** and **mobile-first design** to boost rankings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

This SEO benchmarking project tested how keyword characteristics influence search visibility. While linear regression revealed no significant relationship, Random Forest analysis identified **Keyword Difficulty** as the dominant predictor of SERP performance.

> Going forward, Productfolio.com should focus its SEO strategy on **low-difficulty, high-intent** keywords to improve visibility and drive sustainable growth.
