## Introduction

This analysis segments Productfolio’s users into actionable personas using GA4 behavioral data, revealing how different users engage across the funnel to support targeted, intent-driven marketing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Behavioral Touch points (GA4 Metrics)

-   **Acquisition Channel:** Organic search, referral, direct
-   **Content Type Viewed:** Blog, pricing, feature pages
-   **Engagement:** Session duration, bounce rate, scroll depth
-   **Conversion Path:** Series of events prior to signup

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Funnel Analysis for Macro-Conversions

**Observation:** Out of 343 users who landed on the signup page, only 32 completed the signup—an abandonment rate of 90.7%. This continues through to setup, highlighting significant friction.

> Recommendation: Streamline onboarding for Action Takers and Solution Seekers with simplified forms, tutorials, and progress bars.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Frequency of Key Events

This chart reveals that while sessions and page views are high, key engagement events like `first_visit` and `user_engagement` are relatively lower.

> Insight: Users are exploring but not consistently progressing especially Researchers. Introduce targeted CTAs and nurture flows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📄 Top 5 Most Viewed Pages

Pages like “21 Product Management Frameworks” and “ICE Scoring” bring in significant traffic but lack strong CTAs.

> Action: Personalize these high-traffic pages with intent-specific CTAs and retargeting pixels for nurturing Researchers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Top 5 Pages by Avg. Engagement Time

Pages with the longest engagement times indicate where users invest time deeply. For example, dashboards and use-case pages show up to 353 seconds.

> Strategy: Use insights from these pages (layout, CTA style, interactivity) to revamp low-engagement sections.
