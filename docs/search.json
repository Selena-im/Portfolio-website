Using data from Google Ads and Facebook alongside GA4 insights, we compared ad impact with organic and referral traffic to optimize campaign targeting and creative strategy.\n\n\n\nDescriptive Analytics and Results\nTraffic Source Analysis\nGoogle organic emerged as the top traffic and conversion driver, followed by direct visits. Paid ads (e.g., Google CPC, Facebook Ads) showed fewer overall events but played critical roles across the funnel. Attribution data showed Google CPC peaked at late-stage conversions, while Facebook Ads distributed influence across early, mid, and late funnel stages.\nAttribution Paths Findings\n\nFacebook Ads: 26.73% early, 17.93% mid, 32.04% late\n\nGoogle CPC: 64.35% conversions at late touchpoints\nImplication:\nGoogle Ads = ‚Äúcloser,‚Äù Facebook Ads = full-funnel support\nAttribution Model Comparison\n\n- Under last-click, Google CPC‚Äôs contribution rose +2.8%\n- Facebook Ads stayed stable, indicating multi-touch effectiveness\nRecommendation\nUse Facebook Ads for awareness and lead nurturing, and Google CPC for retargeting and high-intent conversion capture.\n\n\n\nPredictive Analytics\nWe built a linear regression model to predict conversions based on:\n- Ads cost\n- Impressions\n- Clicks\n- Cost per click\nModel Results:\n\n- R¬≤ = 0.082, Adjusted R¬≤ = 0.028\n- No variables significantly predicted conversions\n- Ads cost and CPC dropped due to multicollinearity\nConclusion:\nThe model lacks predictive power. Future improvements include:\n- Adding categorical variables (e.g., channel type)\n- Removing redundant predictors\n- Exploring non-linear models like decision trees\n- Retraining regularly with updated GA4 data\n\n\n\nSummary\nOrganic search leads in volume, while paid ads especially Facebook and Google play essential funnel roles. Attribution modeling confirms complementary roles for paid channels, and early regression modeling highlights the need for enriched feature sets. Recommendations include aligning ad strategy to funnel stage and refining models for better predictive accuracy."
